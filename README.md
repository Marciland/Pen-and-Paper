# Pen & Paper Toolset
Software that provides the ability to create/edit heros based on the dark eye core rules v5 with features to support remotely playing pen and paper.

## This was never meant to be used by anyone except me and my friends.
\
I do not guarantee that this software is working as intended. \
I will not provide any other UI language than german. \

This is build in MAUI which brings support for Android, IOS and Mac but the project is mainly build for Windows, thus the UI is not adjusted for Mobile.
